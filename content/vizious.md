He excelled. Not because he wanted to. Because he had no other way to exist.

In time, he became one of the youngest Leximancers ever initiated into the Circle of Intent—those who believed language could reshape reality. Glyph-magic. Will-script. It was beautiful. Dangerous. And so very close to divine.

And then he met her. And a half-circle became whole.

### Seren.

She wasn’t smarter. But she was braver. Where he obeyed, she questioned. Where he hesitated, she walked. She once told him that truth wasn’t in books, but in the breath between two people brave enough to be seen.

He laughed. Then he followed.

Together, they found something beneath the Temple, down among the ancient arches of the sacred amphitheater. A door with no key. A script no Glyphsmith had ever attempted to translate. Seren stepped closer. Vizius warned her. She turned to him with a sad smile. A slow tilt of her head. 

And then she vanished.

The Circle said she had broken a seal. That she had been consumed by her own hubris.

But Vizious knew otherwise. The door had opened. And she had gone through.

He left the Temple and the Circle days later. No permission. No farewell. Only silence, and the weight of a name he could no longer bear.

Now he walks with scrolls bound in leather made from dreams. He speaks only when it matters, and often, not even then. But he watches. Learns. Listens.

The Tomb calls to him like an unsolved sentence.

And somewhere, maybe just beyond the veil—Seren waits. He is sure of it.

He does not seek glory.

He seeks an ending that means something.
