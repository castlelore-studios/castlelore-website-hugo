He left on a morning that broke gray. No note. No goodbye. Just the soft clack of boots on frost and the knowledge that if he looked back, he’d never leave.

War welcomed him with a laugh and a sword.

He signed his name—then gave it up. In the ranks, names didn’t matter. Only how well you bled. He became a number, then a voice, then a shadow. By the second Iokela campaign, he was leading charges. By the third, he was choosing those who wouldn’t come home.

Barbarian met him in a trench lit by fireflies and blood.

The man’s real name was never spoken. Not outside Wilderburrow. Not after the rites. They called him Barbarian, and he bore it like a shield. Seven feet tall, with shoulders like tomb doors and a voice that cracked stone. But he laughed. Gods, how he laughed.

They became brothers without ceremony. Bound not by blood, but by survival.

Everdawn Vale changed that.

Orders were given that should never have been. A peaceful village razed. Screams that didn’t leave. The two of them argued—one wanting to follow, the other to disobey. Neither won. The Vale burned. And so did everything they believed in.

After that, he ran again.

This time into shadow.

He became a thief—not for greed, but for the silence it gave. He moved through cities like fog, stealing from nobles who drank wine flavored with prophecy. He slipped through palaces, archives, even shrines. Always searching. Never knowing for what.

Then the dreams began.

A tomb beneath the waking world. A voice like cracked bells. A door that hummed his name.

And at the edge of a forgotten road, Barbarian waited.

No accusations. No apologies. Just the weight of the past in his eyes, and a question neither of them spoke aloud.

They walked together, again.

To the Ashen Spire.

To the tavern.

To the others.

He still doesn’t speak of the farm.

He still dreams of fire.

But he walks forward.

And the Tomb waits.
