## The Soulful Steelyard

A whispered mechanism. A dream-forged machine. A weight that must always be borne.

It is not seen with eyes but felt in the soul's marrow—this Steelyard. Half symbol, half construct, it was shaped in the first moments of the Sunrise Age, when the world still remembered the gods, and Light sought to hold its ground against the long night.

They say the powers of Light could not destroy the Darkness outright—only measure it. And so, beneath the world, behind the veil, they built the Steelyard. A vast and hidden scale, metaphysical in purpose but real enough to bleed. It balances virtue and vice, and when it falters, so too does the Dreamweaver—the living fulcrum of the world.

It sleeps beneath the Dreamweaver’s Tomb, not in stone or chamber, but in a place that exists slightly sideways to reality.

Access is not given. It must be earned.

## The Grove Beyond Memory

Far north of the Fellwood Marshes, where the winds forget their names, lies a hidden glade—one that cannot be found unless it chooses to be. The old ones called it the Grove Beyond Memory, a place where truth lingers like mist and time walks in circles.

Only at dawn, during the solstice’s breath—when dreamlight and starlight cross in a halo above the trees—does the path reveal itself. But the unworthy will find only forest. The Grove is protected by illusions older than the written word. It sees through masks.

Its trees are whisperwood, pale and deathless, their limbs unmoved by season. In their center lies a pool—not of water, but of reflection. It mirrors not the sky, but the truth—memories, raw and unedited.

Etched in a forgotten tongue around the pool’s rim are five words: Truth. Debt. Judgment. Sacrifice. Echo.

To stand in the Grove is to feel watched—not by gods, but by your own past.

## The Rites of Weighing

Only three may enter. No more. No less.

To open the path to the Steelyard, three souls must stand at the edge of the pool, each carrying a wound the world cannot see.

> One who has forgiven the unforgivable

> One who has chosen truth over survival

> One who has borne guilt in silence

### The ritual unfolds as follows:

*Memory Offering:* Each lays a token in the pool—an object wrapped in a memory too heavy to carry further. The surface accepts or rejects.

*Spoken Litany:* An ancient prayer, torn from glyphs within the Tomb, must be spoken in a tongue long dead. It does not call. It acknowledges.

*Blood Tithe:* Three drops. No more. Placed on a stone scale beside the pool. If balance is true, the scale glows like a star at twilight.

*Veil Rend:* If all has been done in truth, the air shimmers. A spiral of silver mist unfurls—opening the way to the Steelyard.

**But be warned:** should one of the three lie, or falter, or hide a truth too deep—the Grove will turn hostile. Whisperwood becomes claw and shriek. Echoes scream. The gate does not open. Not for liars.

## Within the Steelyard

To step through is to step into a dream that remembers you.

There are no walls—only bridges of starlight spanning a black abyss. Beneath your feet, the weight of the world. Around you, statues that were once men and women—past Dreamweavers frozen in eternal judgment. Some whisper. Some weep. None speak.

You may see acts replayed—some yours, some others’. Choices that tipped the scale. Moments that mattered.

At the center: a scale of impossible size. One side gleams with light. The other, dark as grief. And as you watch, it shifts—minute by minute—responding not to actions, but to intention. You will know, then, what weight you carry.

## Additional Lore

No one may enter the Grove twice. Those who try are unmade—spirit severed, memory dissolved.

In legend however, there is one who may enter more than once. Their name has been erased. Their story now a curse.

The Steelyard does not judge. It reveals. Judgment lies with you.
