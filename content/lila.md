Lila was born in the harbor-city of Kezmarin, among the pirate-haunted Seven Eyes, where fog wrapped towers like memory and every alley hummed with secrets. Her mother was a mapmaker once, long retired, her hands bent from old compass work and ink stains. Her father died young—some said at sea, others whispered darker things. Lila never asked. What she cared about was her uncle.

Taro.

He was the kind of man who arrived like storms—sudden, loud, always with salt in his hair and laughter in his mouth. He brought her gifts from forgotten ports and stories from sunken ruins. He taught her how to pick locks without shame, how to read a sky for secrets, and how to lie only when the truth might hurt worse.

Then he vanished.

Nobody. No wreckage. Just a single message scratched into a brass compass: Follow the stars.

Everyone said he was dead. Her mother folded his name away like an old letter and warned Lila not to dig too deep.

So she did.

She became a thief of knowledge, a burglar of forgotten lore. She found smugglers who would trade maps for coin, scholars who whispered of ancient tombs, and drunken sailors who spoke of dreams that bled. Always, she moved closer to something she couldn't name.

Then the dreams started.

A voice she knew but couldn't place. A tomb beneath the world. A door that pulsed like a wound. And through it all—his voice, calling her name.

So she packed her knives. Her compass. Her grief.

She hired no one. She trusted no one. 

But someone followed like a shadow. 

He was good, but Lila was better. Her senses razor-sharp. The man wore the dark, earth and moss mottled cloak of a ranger—quiet, older, with eyes that had seen too much and said too little. Ranger or not, she knew a hired sword when she saw one. But something about the way he watched her—like a man who’d buried too many daughters—kept her from confronting him. For now.

Now she walks among strangers. Dreamers. Fighters. Fools.

She does not know if the Tomb holds answers.

But it holds something.

And she will not leave until she knows what.
