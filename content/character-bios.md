# Gerrick

He was not born into faith.

He was carved into it, like a name chiseled into stone by hands not his own.
Gerrick’s earliest memories were not of light or sanctuary, but of ash. He came from a famine-wracked highland Sunthorne village called Lostwood —barely more than a scar of thatch and rock clinging to the throat of the Sunthorne Mountains. His father was a stonemason with cracked knuckles and a voice that never rose above a whisper. His mother died the winter after his ninth summer, her bones picked quiet by cold and plague.

The hooded priests from across the ocean arrived the next spring.

They brought firewood and soup. They sang songs of the Sacred Oath and the Binding Flame. Gerrick had never seen such clean robes, never heard words that sounded like purpose. He was thirteen when he left with them—volunteering, though it felt more like vanishing.

A fortnight at sea. He has never even seen the ocean before. Or such large and ornate ships. He had been sick and terrified the entire voyage. 

At the monastery in faraway Kreigspire, he scrubbed floors and memorized scripture. At first, the words didn’t stay. He dreamed of wind and dust, of his mother’s last cough, of unfinished sentences. But discipline is its own language, and he learned it well.

By twenty, he had been knighted into the Order of the Awakened Flame—a minor paladin brotherhood known more for protecting border shrines than leading crusades. They taught him to burn evil without hatred, to carry the light even when no one watched. But light, Gerrick learned, casts long shadows.
His first real command came during the Timberline Wars, in the southern Feywood, where root and ruin swallowed men like insects. A rogue archpriest had broken the Veil, letting in whispers from something beyond. Gerrick led his Guardians into the forest, torch and steel in hand.

Only two returned.

And neither of them whole.

The Order praised his courage. He was given honors. A blade inscribed with scripture. A title he never used. But he couldn’t scrub the memory of the way his surviving Guardian’s eyes had melted, not from flame—but from terror. The forest had spoken. And Gerrick had no words to answer back.

He didn’t resign. He simply left.

He abandoned his armor in a quiet shrine. Took his old bow. Walked into the world without banner or prayer. For a time, he became a ghost—hunting nightmares that wore familiar skins, defending villages from brigands and gremlins and other monstrosities, never staying longer than the lingering scent of black smoke.

It was Barbarian who later said: “He’s a paladin without a god. Just the wounds left behind.”

He became an outcast, a ranger, not because he believed in the wild, but because he trusted it to be honest. Trees didn’t lie. Wolves didn’t ask for obedience. Shadows didn’t pretend to be light.

Years passed that way; quiet, invisible, service without sermon.

And then a woman in black hired him to retrieve her daughter. No threats. No reward. Just a request and a map marked in grief.

He said yes before he realized why.

Maybe it was the glint in the woman’s eyes—so much like his own before faith burned the shine from them. Maybe it was guilt, wearing a new name. Or maybe, deep down, Gerrick had never stopped wanting to keep people safe.

He still keeps his old blade—wrapped in cloth, unspeaking.

He still remembers the prayers, though he rarely speaks them aloud.
But in the Tomb, where light and memory twist, it is Gerrick who walks ahead.

Not because he is unafraid.

But because he has known failure—and still finds the strength to go on.


# Lila

{{< figure src="/images/lila-disbelief.png" title="Lila" >}}

She never meant to chase ghosts. But the sea teaches hunger before it teaches peace.

Lila was born in the harbor-city of Kezmarin, among the pirate-haunted Seven Eyes, where fog wrapped towers like memory and every alley hummed with secrets. Her mother was a mapmaker once, long retired, her hands bent from old compass work and ink stains. Her father died young—some said at sea, others whispered darker things. Lila never asked. What she cared about was her uncle.

Taro.

He was the kind of man who arrived like storms—sudden, loud, always with salt in his hair and laughter in his mouth. He brought her gifts from forgotten ports and stories from sunken ruins. He taught her how to pick locks without shame, how to read a sky for secrets, and how to lie only when the truth might hurt worse.

Then he vanished.

Nobody. No wreckage. Just a single message scratched into a brass compass: Follow the stars.

Everyone said he was dead. Her mother folded his name away like an old letter and warned Lila not to dig too deep.

So she did.

She became a thief of knowledge, a burglar of forgotten lore. She found smugglers who would trade maps for coin, scholars who whispered of ancient tombs, and drunken sailors who spoke of dreams that bled. Always, she moved closer to something she couldn't name.

Then the dreams started.

A voice she knew but couldn't place. A tomb beneath the world. A door that pulsed like a wound. And through it all—his voice, calling her name.

So she packed her knives. Her compass. Her grief.

She hired no one. She trusted no one. 

But someone followed like a shadow. 

He was good, but Lila was better. Her senses razor-sharp. The man wore the dark, earth and moss mottled cloak of a ranger—quiet, older, with eyes that had seen too much and said too little. Ranger or not, she knew a hired sword when she saw one. But something about the way he watched her—like a man who’d buried too many daughters—kept her from confronting him. For now.

Now she walks among strangers. Dreamers. Fighters. Fools.

She does not know if the Tomb holds answers.

But it holds something.

And she will not leave until she knows what.

# Vizious

He was born beneath a dome of mirrored stone, where the walls whispered spells older than the sun.

Vizious was not his birth name. That one he buried long ago—along with the boy who wanted to heal things. His family were acolytes of the Archive Temple of Noctherein in Dol Marris, a city of scholars built atop the ribcage of a dead god. They didn’t raise him so much as assign him. Tutors for every hour. Recitations in lieu of lullabies. Even love, when it came, was wrapped in riddles and footnotes.

{{< figure src="/images/vizious_center_face.png" title="Vizious" >}}

He excelled. Not because he wanted to. Because he had no other way to exist.

In time, he became one of the youngest Leximancers ever initiated into the Circle of Intent—those who believed language could reshape reality. Glyph-magic. Will-script. It was beautiful. Dangerous. And so very close to divine.

And then he met her. And a half-circle became whole.
Seren.

She wasn’t smarter. But she was braver. Where he obeyed, she questioned. Where he hesitated, she walked. She once told him that truth wasn’t in books, but in the breath between two people brave enough to be seen.

He laughed. Then he followed.

Together, they found something beneath the Temple, down among the ancient arches of the sacred amphitheater. A door with no key. A script no Glyphsmith had ever attempted to translate. Seren stepped closer. Vizius warned her. She turned to him with a sad smile. A slow tilt of her head. 

And then she vanished.

The Circle said she had broken a seal. That she had been consumed by her own hubris.

But Vizious knew otherwise. The door had opened. And she had gone through.

He left the Temple and the Circle days later. No permission. No farewell. Only silence, and the weight of a name he could no longer bear.

Now he walks with scrolls bound in leather made from dreams. He speaks only when it matters, and often, not even then. But he watches. Learns. Listens.

The Tomb calls to him like an unsolved sentence.

And somewhere, maybe just beyond the veil—Seren waits. He is sure of it.

He does not seek glory.

He seeks an ending that means something.

# The Player 

He never meant to fight. He meant to run.

The farm sat on the edge of nothing—a wind-wracked spit of land where crops died thirsty and fathers wore silence like armor. Days were spent breaking stones and chasing goats that didn’t want to live. Nights were colder than the gods allowed. His family tilled the same miserable soil for generations. They called it heritage. He called it burial.

He left on a morning that broke gray. No note. No goodbye. Just the soft clack of boots on frost and the knowledge that if he looked back, he’d never leave.

War welcomed him with a laugh and a sword.

He signed his name—then gave it up. In the ranks, names didn’t matter. Only how well you bled. He became a number, then a voice, then a shadow. By the second Iokela campaign, he was leading charges. By the third, he was choosing those who wouldn’t come home.

Barbarian met him in a trench lit by fireflies and blood.

The man’s real name was never spoken. Not outside Wilderburrow. Not after the rites. They called him Barbarian, and he bore it like a shield. Seven feet tall, with shoulders like tomb doors and a voice that cracked stone. But he laughed. Gods, how he laughed.

They became brothers without ceremony. Bound not by blood, but by survival.

Everdawn Vale changed that.

Orders were given that should never have been. A peaceful village razed. Screams that didn’t leave. The two of them argued—one wanting to follow, the other to disobey. Neither won. The Vale burned. And so did everything they believed in.

After that, he ran again.

This time into shadow.

He became a thief—not for greed, but for the silence it gave. He moved through cities like fog, stealing from nobles who drank wine flavored with prophecy. He slipped through palaces, archives, even shrines. Always searching. Never knowing for what.

Then the dreams began.

A tomb beneath the waking world. A voice like cracked bells. A door that hummed his name.

And at the edge of a forgotten road, Barbarian waited.

No accusations. No apologies. Just the weight of the past in his eyes, and a question neither of them spoke aloud.

They walked together, again.

To the Ashen Spire.

To the tavern.

To the others.

He still doesn’t speak of the farm.

He still dreams of fire.

But he walks forward.

And the Tomb waits.

# Barbarian

His true name is not spoken. Not by outsiders. Not even in memory.

He was born to the Clan Varosk, one of the oldest Laconic bloodlines still bound to the stoneflower groves of Wilderburrow. Centaur in form, but more than myth—he was carved of thunder and sacred vows. His people do not name children until they’ve survived five winters and five tests. When his time came, he stood in the river for three nights and did not sleep.

{{< figure src="/images/barbarian.png" title="Barbarian" >}}

They called him Titus Storm-Walker, but only in the old tongue. To the world beyond Wilderburrow, he became Barbarian. A name born of ignorance—and earned through fear.

He might have stayed. His hooves knew every slope of the Greenwild Hills. His breath harmonized with the wind. But tradition is a cage when the fire inside you won’t go quiet. The elders taught patience. He had none.

He left not for glory, nor exile—but for answers to many questions.

Why did the Wilderburrow never venture from their lands? Why did they hide, hoard, endure while the rest of the world burned and bled? He wanted to know if the old laws were wisdom—or cowardice.

So he walked from the green into the ash.

He found war. Too much of it.

For twelve years, he fought in campaigns that were not his. Not because he believed in flags, but because he believed in the people beneath them. He shielded the broken. He carried the dying. He grew feared, then respected, then mythic.

He met the player in the trenches of Northern Aeteqane, where the sun turned black and mercy was outlawed. They fought back-to-back. Laughed between screams. Cursed together. Survived.

Brothers made not by blood, but by the way they broke.

He never asked his friend to understand Wilderburrow. Only to trust him.
Then came Everdawn Vale. And nothing was the same after. 

In the blood and fire, their friendship loosened, broke, lost in the black smoke and silence of a dead village. They parted ways without a word—both carrying away the soul-tearing memories of the Vale wherever they went.

When the dreams came—of doors that bled, of a world asleep and whispering, he knew the player would come. And when they met again, he said nothing. Just turned, and began to walk.

He carries a poleaxe taller than most men, carved with runes that no scholar has ever translated.

He wears little armor.

He seldom speaks. But when he does, it shakes more than stone.

He is not here for destiny.

He is here because someone must be.

And if the tomb must break someone—let it try him first.
