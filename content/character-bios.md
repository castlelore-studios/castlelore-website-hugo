# Gerrick

He was not born into faith.

He was carved into it, like a name chiseled into stone by hands not his own. [<span class="more-link">MORE</span>]({{< ref "gerrick.md" >}})

# Lila

She never meant to chase ghosts. But the sea teaches hunger before it teaches peace. [<span class="more-link">MORE</span>]({{< ref "lila.md" >}})

# Vizious

He was born beneath a dome of mirrored stone, where the walls whispered spells older than the sun.

Vizious was not his birth name. That one he buried long ago—along with the boy who wanted to heal things. His family were acolytes of the Archive Temple of Noctherein in Dol Marris, a city of scholars built atop the ribcage of a dead god. They didn’t raise him so much as assign him. Tutors for every hour. Recitations in lieu of lullabies. Even love, when it came, was wrapped in riddles and footnotes. [<span class="more-link">MORE</span>]({{< ref "vizious.md" >}})

# Player

He never meant to fight. He meant to run.

The farm sat on the edge of nothing—a wind-wracked spit of land where crops died thirsty and fathers wore silence like armor. Days were spent breaking stones and chasing goats that didn’t want to live. Nights were colder than the gods allowed. His family tilled the same miserable soil for generations. They called it heritage. He called it burial. [<span class="more-link">MORE</span>]({{< ref "player.md" >}})

# Barbarian

His true name is not spoken. Not by outsiders. Not even in memory. [<span class="more-link">MORE</span>]({{< ref "barbarian.md" >}})
