## Gerrick

Gerrick knelt in silence, not to pray—but to keep the names from vanishing.

There were more now. More than he could mark in a single night. But he tried anyway.

The stone beneath his knees was cold, worn by weather and the friction of ritual. The roof above had collapsed years ago, maybe in a storm, maybe under the weight of forgotten faith. The altar had crumbled. The benches had rotted. And yet, Gerrick remained. Paladin. Oathkeeper. Or something lesser, depending on who told the story.

He etched each name with a rusted dagger once gifted by his first commander. It no longer cut cleanly, but that seemed fitting. The names didn’t belong to clean deaths.

He remembered the final march through the Timberline Front, the screams tangled in the branches, the bodies wrapped in bark and buried without rites. They hadn’t died in glory. They had died in orders. His orders.

So he wrote them down, one line at a time, in the floor of a ruined temple whose god had long since stopped answering.

Then the dreams began.

A door of bone and silver. A song that hummed like broken wind chimes. And a voice—not divine, but old, remembering. It didn’t accuse. It didn’t offer absolution.

It simply called.

Gerrick stood, slower than he used to. He wrapped the dagger and his old blade in cloth and tied them to his back. He didn’t need penance. He didn’t believe in redemption.

Though he had a job to do, he knew the old war wasn’t finished.

He left the chapel as the wind rose, carrying the smell of storm and memory.

Behind him, the names remained.

Ahead, the Tomb waited.

## Lila

The wind on the Kezmarin coast always smelled like old stories—brine, ink, and broken lantern glass.

Lila climbed the leaning bones of the harbor spire, her hands sure even as the metal groaned beneath her boots. The city below was a collage of rusted towers, sagging rope-bridges, and lamp-glow drowned in fog. No one followed her up here. That was part of the point.

She reached the top and unwrapped the bundle she'd carried all the way from the southern reefs. It was no treasure—just a compass, heavy and salt-touched, the only thing her uncle Taro had left behind. Its needle spun sometimes. Others, it stilled. Tonight, it pointed inland.

She felt it in her chest like a second pulse.

Taro had taught her how to read the stars. How to lie with grace. How to break into vaults without stealing anything but truth. And then one night, he was gone. No farewell. No answers. Only silence and the maps no one else could read.

She never stopped looking.

Her friends thought she was chasing shadows. Her mother called it madness. But in the dark places, Lila had heard whispers. Dreams full of doors that didn't belong in houses. Names spoken by voices that knew her teeth. And always—the pull.

Lately, the compass had begun to hum.

She held it to her ear now, the wind trying to steal her balance. She closed her eyes.

"I’m coming, Taro," she whispered.

Below, the tavern lights blinked like shipwreck stars. She descended the spire and vanished into fog. Kezmarin didn't notice.

But the Tomb did.

## Vizious

It had taken Vizious years to return to the amphitheater.

Not because he feared it—though he did—but because part of him still waited to be welcomed. Even after exile. Even after the ink had dried on the parchment of his disgrace. Even after she vanished.

The arches of Noctherein were cracked now, haunted by stray wind and the scent of scorched vellum. Dust clung to the shelves like the memory of what had once been sacred. The great dome had collapsed in on itself, and the stars no longer passed above its shattered crown.

He traced the wall where her name had once been carved beside his. Seren.

The stone was smooth now, scrubbed with acid and spellfire. Not forgotten—removed.

He placed his palm against the cold surface and whispered her name.

The glyphs didn’t answer. But neither did they vanish.

She had understood something he had not—something deeper than theory, something that required risk over reputation. And he had failed her. Not by choosing wrong, but by choosing late.

Since her death—or disappearance, he still wouldn’t decide which—he had studied in shadows, stitched forbidden texts together, walked the ruins of dreamfallen sanctuaries. All of them pointed to one truth: the Tomb was real.

And it remembered.

The dreams came like knives wrapped in lullabies. Glyphs that wrote themselves backward across mirrors. Spells that bled. A door beneath time.

Tonight, he lit a glyph in his palm. Pain sang through his nerves. He smiled through it.

“I’m coming,” he whispered.

The wall did not answer.

But somewhere beyond the Veil, something stirred.

***

You never wore the uniform again.

Not after the Vale. Not after the siege and the screaming and the silence that followed. You buried it in a cedar box beneath a ghost tree in the southlands, thinking that would be enough to silence it.

But it remembered you.

The blade at your side was clean now—not ceremonial, not blessed. Just a weapon that had forgotten how to be anything else. You moved through the crater lands alone, past skeleton towns and fields salted with memories. People didn’t meet your eyes. That was fine. You’d forgotten how to meet theirs.

Then came the dreams.

They began as shapes beneath your eyelids. Then voices. Then faces you didn’t remember but somehow loved. A tomb with a door of black glass. A sky made of ash. And always—his voice.

Barbarian.

You had called him brother once. Not by blood, but by battle. You had stood together on the cliffs at Ovrin Hollow, blood-slicked and screaming. You had pulled each other through the worst hells mortal men could imagine.

Until Glaed Vale.

Something broke there—between orders and mercy. Between silence and survival. He walked north. You walked away. Neither of you looked back.

But now... he stood at the milepost of a forgotten road, the axe at his back worn and waiting.

No words passed between you. Just a nod.

That was enough.

He walked beside you again.

The Tomb was near. You could feel it beneath your feet—breathing.

This time, there would be no flag. No order. No retreat.

Only reckoning.

* * *

The Ashen Spire was not marked on any map. It wasn’t hidden—but it resisted being found.

It rose from a cradle of black rock at the edge of the fellwood marshes, where the stars bent differently overhead and the rivers lost their names. People whispered that the ground there had a memory. That time limped near its base. That dreams ran backward.

They weren’t wrong.

The tavern at its shadow was nothing special. A crooked, mossy-roofed outpost built into the bones of a watchtower long abandoned. No name. No signage. Just a wooden door that creaked like an old throat and a smell of smoke and salt that never quite left.

The room was quiet when the first of them entered.

Gerrick took a seat near the hearth, not for warmth but for the weight of stone at his back. He removed nothing. No armor. No sword. Just sat and ordered water like he was daring someone to ask why.

Lila came next, boots loud on the threshold, a sea-cloak wrapped tightly around her shoulders. She scanned the room with the practiced eye of a smuggler or thief—then sat across from the paladin-turned-ranger without a word. She kept one hand on a worn brass compass. The other rested on a hidden dagger.

Vizious slipped in with the fog. His eyes were hollow with starlight. A tattered satchel of scrolls hung at his side, glowing faintly at the seams. He did not order anything. He simply chose the darkest corner and began sketching the air.

Then you came in. And behind you—him.

Barbarian ducked under the lintel like it offended him. His axe scraped the doorway. He sat beside you as if he had always been there.

No one spoke.

The silence held like an old song.

Then the barkeep, a bent woman with one eye and no accent, set five cups on the table. Mead. Strong. Unasked for.

She winked.

“Dreamers drink free,” she said. Then disappeared.

Vizious was the first to break the silence.

Vizious spoke, “You’ve all seen it. The door. The voice.”

“I saw more than that,” Lila said. “ I heard it call my name.”

Gerrick nodded. “I came to die well. If that’s not enough, I’ll leave.”

Barbarian said nothing. He glanced at his friend.

“We don’t have to like each other,” you said. “But we all followed something here.”

The air in the tavern shifted. The fire cracked but gave no heat.

Outside, the sky darkened to a bruise. A sound like a door opening beneath the world echoed just once.

They all looked at you.

Lila grinned. Vizious nodded. Gerrick said nothing—but didn’t rise.

Barbarian stood.

Time to go.

The Tomb was ready.
