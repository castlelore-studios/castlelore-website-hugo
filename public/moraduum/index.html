  <h1 id="moraduum-the-dreamweavers-shadow">Moraduum: The Dreamweaver’s Shadow</h1>
<p>Moraduum is not merely an external antagonist—it is the severed shadow of the Dreamweaver himself. Once a mortal who ascended to guard the veil between waking and dream, the Dreamweaver sought to balance all things: light and dark, memory and forgetting, suffering and solace.</p>
<p>But part of him resisted.</p>
<p>That part became Moraduum: a cast-off fragment of soul too volatile, too consumed with sorrow and futility, to bear the burden of cosmic stewardship. It sees memory as a cruelty, and dreams as cages. Where the Dreamweaver seeks to preserve meaning, Moraduum seeks to dissolve it.</p>
<p>They are not enemies. They are reflections. One cannot exist without the other.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/mirrors.webp"><figcaption>
      <h4>Reflections</h4>

</figure>

<p>Their conflict is not over control—it is over truth. Whether the world should endure its burdens or be released from them.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, Moraduum invades dreams, questions the party’s motives, offers gentle erasure in place of painful remembrance. As the Tomb deepens, the line between the two beings begins to blur—until the player must confront them both and choose what kind of future, or oblivion, they wish to inherit.</p>
<p>In the final hour, it is not a battle of sword and spell, but of will and identity.</p>
<p>To fight Moraduum is to face what the Dreamweaver could not.</p>
<p>To embrace it may mean the end of suffering. Or of self.</p>
<h1 id="the-splinters-of-moraduum">The Splinters of Moraduum</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>illias aier kiorda dias moltis di Moraduum / We are born within the cold eye of Moraduum.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>illias aier corlis di lunis Moraduum / We are washed in the rising darkness of Moraduum.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>illias aier uniorit avre miar di Moraduum / We are one with the ever-changing face of Moraduum.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>illias aier itas anaslithum. Illias aier itas Moraduum fimalia / We are the Splinters of Night. We are harbingers of the Nightmare.
illias aier itas pallidas morr / We are Pale Death.
–Moraduum Obscurum</p></blockquote>
<p>The Splinters of Moraduum are its incarnate shadows—transformed and possessed priests of the cult known as Moraduum-Sinta. They serve under High Priest Silarias, a fugitive figure who fled the northern reaches of Iokela during the Sorrowing (the Purge Wars) and led his followers into the wilderness between Bloodraven and the Fractured Peaks.</p>
<p>These Splinters are more than fanatics. They are avatars—living conduits of Moraduum’s will, corrupted by nightmare and consecrated by forgetting. In appearance, they are tall and unnervingly elegant, with translucent skin, white hair, and silver eyes. Yet their forms are mutable; they can appear as any human. And worse—they can appear familiar.</p>

<p>It is said that the Splinters absorb moonlight, their powers waxing with the lunar cycle. They possess the ability to transform physically and mentally, to induce hallucinations, and to infect dreams with subtle madness. Some whisper they can become invisible under the new moon, while others claim they can drain a soul through mere touch.</p>
<p>They command both literal and symbolic tides: water and blood, the seas and the heart. Wherever mist gathers, they are near. This phenomenon—called the Mists of Madness—precedes outbreaks of shared delusions, mass sleepwalking, or memory collapse.</p>
<p>Each Splinter is often accompanied by a spectral companion: giant ghostly ravens, harbingers of their silent arrival.</p>
<p>Among their deadliest members are the Night Blades, assassin-priests cloaked in fog and silence. They appear without warning, strike without sound, and vanish without trace. No one has seen the same Night Blade twice—or lived to compare.</p>
<p>They can be anywhere.</p>
<p>They can be anyone.
And they will destroy all who would attempt to restore the Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>The Dreamweaver locked this aspect of himself away to protect the balance.</p>
<p>But now it walks.</p>
<p>And it remembers.</p>
