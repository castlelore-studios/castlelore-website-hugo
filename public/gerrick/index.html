  <p>Gerrick’s earliest memories were not of light or sanctuary, but of ash. He came from a famine-wracked highland Sunthorne village called Lostwood —barely more than a scar of thatch and rock clinging to the throat of the Sunthorne Mountains. His father was a stonemason with cracked knuckles and a voice that never rose above a whisper. His mother died the winter after his ninth summer, her bones picked quiet by cold and plague.</p>

<p>The hooded priests from across the ocean arrived the next spring.</p>
<p>They brought firewood and soup. They sang songs of the Sacred Oath and the Binding Flame. Gerrick had never seen such clean robes, never heard words that sounded like purpose. He was thirteen when he left with them—volunteering, though it felt more like vanishing.</p>
<p>A fortnight at sea. He has never even seen the ocean before. Or such large and ornate ships. He had been sick and terrified the entire voyage.</p>
<p>At the monastery in faraway Kreigspire, he scrubbed floors and memorized scripture. At first, the words didn’t stay. He dreamed of wind and dust, of his mother’s last cough, of unfinished sentences. But discipline is its own language, and he learned it well.</p>
<p>By twenty, he had been knighted into the Order of the Awakened Flame—a minor paladin brotherhood known more for protecting border shrines than leading crusades. They taught him to burn evil without hatred, to carry the light even when no one watched. But light, Gerrick learned, casts long shadows.</p>
<p>His first real command came during the Timberline Wars, in the southern Feywood, where root and ruin swallowed men like insects. A rogue archpriest had broken the Veil, letting in whispers from something beyond. Gerrick led his Guardians into the forest, torch and steel in hand.</p>
<p>Only two returned.</p>
<p>And neither of them whole.</p>
<p>The Order praised his courage. He was given honors. A blade inscribed with scripture. A title he never used. But he couldn’t scrub the memory of the way his surviving Guardian’s eyes had melted, not from flame—but from terror. The forest had spoken. And Gerrick had no words to answer back.</p>
<p>He didn’t resign. He simply left.</p>
<p>He abandoned his armor in a quiet shrine. Took his old bow. Walked into the world without banner or prayer. For a time, he became a ghost—hunting nightmares that wore familiar skins, defending villages from brigands and gremlins and other monstrosities, never staying longer than the lingering scent of black smoke.</p>
<p>It was Barbarian who later said: “He’s a paladin without a god. Just the wounds left behind.”</p>
<p>He became an outcast, a ranger, not because he believed in the wild, but because he trusted it to be honest. Trees didn’t lie. Wolves didn’t ask for obedience. Shadows didn’t pretend to be light.</p>
<p>Years passed that way; quiet, invisible, service without sermon.</p>
<p>And then a woman in black hired him to retrieve her daughter. No threats. No reward. Just a request and a map marked in grief.</p>
<p>He said yes before he realized why.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the glint in the woman’s eyes—so much like his own before faith burned the shine from them. Maybe it was guilt, wearing a new name. Or maybe, deep down, Gerrick had never stopped wanting to keep people safe.</p>
<p>He still keeps his old blade—wrapped in cloth, unspeaking.</p>
<p>He still remembers the prayers, though he rarely speaks them aloud.</p>
<p>But in the Tomb, where light and memory twist, it is Gerrick who walks ahead.</p>
<p>Not because he is unafraid.</p>
<p>But because he has known failure—and still finds the strength to go on.</p>
