          <div class="bio">
  <p>He was born to the Clan Varosk, one of the oldest Laconic bloodlines still bound to the stoneflower groves of Wilderburrow. Centaur in form, but more than myth—he was carved of thunder and sacred vows. His people do not name children until they’ve survived five winters and five tests. When his time came, he stood in the river for three nights and did not sleep.</p>

<p>They called him Titus Storm-Walker, but only in the old tongue. To the world beyond Wilderburrow, he became Barbarian. A name born of ignorance—and earned through fear.</p>
<p>He might have stayed. His hooves knew every slope of the Greenwild Hills. His breath harmonized with the wind. But tradition is a cage when the fire inside you won’t go quiet. The elders taught patience. He had none.</p>
<p>He left not for glory, nor exile—but for answers to many questions.</p>
<p>Why did the Wilderburrow never venture from their lands? Why did they hide, hoard, endure while the rest of the world burned and bled? He wanted to know if the old laws were wisdom—or cowardice.</p>
<p>So he walked from the green into the ash.</p>
<p>He found war. Too much of it.</p>
<p>For twelve years, he fought in campaigns that were not his. Not because he believed in flags, but because he believed in the people beneath them. He shielded the broken. He carried the dying. He grew feared, then respected, then mythic.</p>
<p>He met the player in the trenches of Northern Aeteqane, where the sun turned black and mercy was outlawed. They fought back-to-back. Laughed between screams. Cursed together. Survived.</p>
<p>Brothers made not by blood, but by the way they broke.</p>
<p>He never asked his friend to understand Wilderburrow. Only to trust him.
Then came Everdawn Vale. And nothing was the same after.
In the blood and fire, their friendship loosened, broke, lost in the black smoke and silence of a dead village. They parted ways without a word—both carrying away the soul-tearing memories of the Vale wherever they went.</p>
<p>When the dreams came—of doors that bled, of a world asleep and whispering, he knew the player would come. And when they met again, he said nothing. Just turned, and began to walk.</p>
<p>He carries a poleaxe taller than most men, carved with runes that no scholar has ever translated.</p>
<p>He wears little armor.</p>
<p>He seldom speaks. But when he does, it shakes more than stone.</p>
<p>He is not here for destiny.</p>
<p>He is here because someone must be.</p>
<p>And if the tomb must break someone—let it try him first.</p>
